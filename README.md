Orchestration is the arrangement of a piece of music in parts so that it can be played by an orchestra (from the Oxford Advanced Learnerâ€™s Dictionary).
In other terms, it is the process of organizing the different components of a system in order for them to be (correctly) executed by a generic infrastructure.

Leonard Bernstein was an exceptional composer (his most famous work being the soundtrack of West Side Story), pianist, and conductor in his days.

During this project, you are going to become the Leonard Bernstein of containers!
